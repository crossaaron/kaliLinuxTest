TCP / IP 

Protocol - standard used for communication

OSI Model:	(all people seem to need data processing)

	-7 layers of the model 

		- Application  - network API’s  - GATEWAY
		- Presentation  - Formatting
		- Session - Synchronization
		- Transport - Packets
		- Network - Addressing/Routing - ROUTER
		- Data Link - Data Frames - BRIDGE/SWITCH - add header and trailer to data packet
		- Physical - Hardware - REPEATER

TCP/IP Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
	- can be used in local network structure
	- based off of DARPA model

DARPA model -> 4 layer
	- Application.  —  App / Près / Sess/ 
	- Transport — Trans
	- Internet — Network
	- Network Access — Data Link / Physical

Transport Layer Protocols 
	- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol 
		- one to one
		- connection - oriented -> connection must be established before information exchanged (3-way handshake)
		- reliable communication

	- UDP - User Datagram Protocol
		- connectionless 
		- URELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS -> no acknowledgment (i.e . Mail vs. certified mail (TCP) ) 

Internet Layer Protocols 
	- IP -> Internet Protocol
		- addressing 
		- routing

	- ARP -> address resolution protocol
		- resolves the IP address to hardware address 

	- ICMP -> Internet Control Message Protocol
		- diagnostic / error reporting

	- IGMP -> Internet Group Management Protocol
		-manages IP multicast group membership

UNICAST / MULTICAST / BROADCAST / ANYCAST
 1-1 /  1- few / 1- many (one source / 1 to (one -many)

IP address -> 32 bit address used to uniquely identify a computer on a network
	- networkIDportion / HostID portion

	IP address: 192.168.10.1
	subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  -> 255’s determine Nework ID / 0’s determine Host ID
	
	- for every IP address there is a complimentary subnet mask to define the structure

Ping - packet internet groper

Rules for IP Addressing - 
	- address made up by octets. (8bits)
		-192.168.10.101
	- Each octet can only have a number from 0 to 255
	- first octet can’t be 127. (Reserved for diagnostics). 
		- 127.0.0.1 know as loopback (localhost) 
	- host ID cannot be all 0’s or all 255’s
		- 0 reserved for network ID
		- 255 reserved for Broadcast

Classfull IP Addressing:  
	- A Class : 1-126	255.0.0.0
	-B Class : 128 -191	255.255.0.0
	-C Class: 192-223 255.255.255.0

	-D Class: 224-239 multicast
	-E Class: 240-243 Experimental

Private vs. Public IP addressing

	PRIVATE
		A Class: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		B Class: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		C Class: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

		- hosts assigned private IP address can get to Internet through Network Address Translation
		
NAT
	- use of Nat server to connect private servers to internet.  Uses 2 diff network cards to accomplish
		- 1 for internal coms,  1 for external coms 
		- NAT server does communicating with outside and returns it to inside network

*********************************************************************
*********************************************************************


Router
	- forwards data packets along a network
	- networks can only communicate with other networks through routers	
VPN 
	- virtual private network

Default Gateway
	- represents the IP address of a ROUTER that a computer uses to communicate outside of its network
	- must be on same network of as computers it is connecting out 

Subnetting
	-> process of taking a large network and dividing It into smaller networks to increase efficiency and  manageability
	
	network 		172.16.0.0 {65534 Hosts}
	subnet 		255.255.0.0

	subnet1		172.16.1.0 {254 hosts}
	subnet2		172.16.2.0 {254 hosts}
	subnet3 		172.16.3.0 {254 hosts}
	subnet MASK 	255.255.255.0   
	
	**main role of IT admin is to organized network structure to break up into smaller manageable chunks
